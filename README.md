# TicTacToe

Tic Tac Toe, also known as Noughts and Crosses, is a classic two-player board game where players take turns marking spaces in a 3x3 grid. The objective of the game is to align three of one's own symbols horizontally, vertically, or diagonally.

This project implements the Tic Tac Toe game in Java, providing a straightforward graphical interface for players to interact with the game grid.
